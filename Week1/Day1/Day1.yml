08:45 to 09:00 -> Breakout Session




javascript --> interpreter programming language
           --> light weight 
           --> objectOriented (Prototype based)
           --> node.js engine for execution outside the browser
           --> js engine (browser specific)
        Features:
         -->supports both front end and backend dev (full stack development)
           clientside and server side validation
           Even driven architecture (event loop)
           asynchronous programming
           Single thread non blocking i/o


What is JavaScript
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-based scripting language used to 
create dynamic and interactive web pages.

Why JavaScript is used
It allows web pages to respond to user actions like clicks, typing, and navigation 
without reloading the page.

Problem it solves
HTML gives structure and CSS gives style, but JavaScript adds behavior and logic to 
make web applications interactive and functional.

Key points
Runs in the browser (client-side)
Can also run on server using Node.js
Supports OOP, functional, and event-driven programming
Widely used in automation tools like Playwright


Interpreter
An interpreter reads, translates, and executes code line by line at runtime.

Why used
Simple execution model and easy debugging.

Problem it solves
Allows code to run without a separate compilation step.


JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler)
JIT compiles code into machine code at runtime, just before execution.

Why used
Improves performance by converting frequently used code into optimized native code.

Problem it solves
Reduces execution time compared to pure interpretation.

Key Differences

Interpreter
Executes line by line
Slower execution
No optimization
Errors shown line by line

JIT Compiler
Compiles during runtime
Faster execution
Optimizes hot code paths
Better performance for large applications



js -->transpiled 
  parsing the code -->byte code exe -->binaries(0's and 1's)

jit compiler
  variables -->a,b
   expressions--> *



create
fileName.js 















    
Datatypes
  -->type of information you store 
  primitive and non primitive -->object specific array

   number -> whole , decimal
   var num=456789 or 456.97

   string -> name,address
   var empName="Dilip"or'Dilip'or`Dilip`

   boolean -> true,false
   var status=true

   undefined-> variable declared but no value assigned
   var data  

   null -->intentionally to make the varible null (not using the value)
   var data=null 

   bigInt -->long numbers 12345678900000987n

   symbol --> unique information -->accessed in the way of object type
var tr=Symbol("id")


var(1995) -->keyword to declare a variable to 2015 till ES6 intoduce
var

var data=98
var -> variable declaration
data -> variable name
98-> value assigned


   Number -->holds  data -->single , multiple digits, decimals

   filename -->camelCase
   variables -->camelCase -->isActive
   class -->PascalCase  --> LoginPage

run the code 
 node fileName.js
